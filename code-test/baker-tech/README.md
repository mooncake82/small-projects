#### Task

Below is a wireframe for a very simple trading system which you need to build as an HTML5 single page application.
You can use any tools, techniques, frameworks and open source software libraries that you are comfortable with. The only restriction is that we would like the application code to be written in TypeScript.

#### Application features
1. A header at the top of the screen which contains a logo.
2. A section in the middle showing some prices which **you are generating randomly client side**.
3. An arrow points up if the current price is higher than the previous price and down if lower. 
4. The buy button allows the user to trade, which adds a new row in the grid at the bottom at the current price.
5. A grid at the bottom which shows the trades that the user has performed using the Buy buttons in the prices section.


#### Essentials
- A layout resembling the wireframe on the previous page.
- Prices changing roughly once a second.
- Different prices for different currency pairs.
- The grid at the bottom populates when the buttons on the tiles are clicked.
-  Some simple unit tests.

###### It would be great if

- You could make it look nicer than the wireframe.
- The prices are realistic.
