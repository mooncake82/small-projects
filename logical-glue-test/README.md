# LogicalGlueTest

## What went well?
- I really enjoyed the test.
- I learned how to use better *highcharts* 
- I am very happy with the styles and design

##What could be improved (went OK, but could be better)

- Make a btn component to be reused
- Add a button to add more objs to the array of objs provide
- Add css media query for responsiveness


##What went badly

- After implemted the *bar-chart series graph* from *higcharts* I realised that there was not way to highlight the *fuzzy areas*. I though I could have placed gray areas on the side of each bar if they were needed but I simply couldn't.
- I went for a custom solution which on paper seemed to be fine but it forced me to add some hardcoded part with the result of making the code less dymanic. I coudl have impoved this part but I wasn't already happy with this solution.
