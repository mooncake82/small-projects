Developer Brief (front end)

## App brief

Develop a JavaScript web app that maintains a list of bookmarks (links).
 
- The user is able to add/edit/delete any link in the list.  
- The application should only use front-end technologies (ie no backend database!).

## Flow

### Overview page

- Displays a form on the top of the page that lets a user submit a link. 
- The form should validate whether the input is a valid URL and exists.
- Displays the a list of links with pagination so 20 links are shown per page. 
- The pagination should include numbered pagination with next and previous links eg. < 1 2 3 >.

### Results page

- Contains a message thanking the user for a submission.
- Displays the user's submission.
- Includes a link back to the overview page.

#### Technologies to use

- Basic layout (HTML/CSS).
- Pure JavaScript (although Angular is permissible if you want want to use a framework).

### Deliverables

- **Form validation** must be custom written.
- All links entered in the list must persist page reload.
- Where applicable, all code should follow the Google style guidelines.
- All code should be commented.
- The application should be accompanied by a brief TDD (Technical Design Document) outlining the solution's design and any limitations.
- Source code to be linked to a repository (private or public).
- A public link to the final app.

Feel free to add any additional features that further demonstrates your skills.
